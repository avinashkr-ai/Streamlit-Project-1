This project provides a Streamlit application that uses machine learning to predict the species of Iris flowers. The app takes four features as input (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and outputs the predicted species.

## 📋 Summary

This Streamlit application allows users to input the sepal and petal measurements of an Iris flower and receive a prediction of its species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica). It leverages the Streamlit framework for creating an interactive user interface and a pre-trained machine learning model for classification. The app targets users interested in exploring machine learning applications, specifically in the domain of botanical classification. The primary technology used is Python with the Streamlit library.

## ✨ Features

- 🌿 **Iris Classification:** Predicts the species of Iris flowers based on user-provided measurements.
