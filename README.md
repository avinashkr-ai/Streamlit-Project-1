## Description

This project is a basic Streamlit application. It serves as a template or starting point for building more complex Streamlit apps. While its functionality is currently minimal, it provides a ready-to-run environment for experimenting with Streamlit and its features. It's a great resource for beginners learning Streamlit or for quickly prototyping ideas.

## Features

*   **Simple UI:** Demonstrates a basic Streamlit user interface.
*   **Easy Setup:** Designed for quick installation and execution.
*   **Extensible:** Provides a foundation for adding more features and functionality.
*   **Python Powered:**  Leverages the simplicity and power of Python.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Streamlit-Project-1.git
    cd Streamlit-Project-1
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Streamlit:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the app:**

    Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Modify and Experiment:**

    Edit the `streamlit_app.py` file to add your own Streamlit components and features.  For example, you can add a simple text display:

    ```python
    import streamlit as st

    st.title("My First Streamlit App")
    st.write("Hello, Streamlit!")
    ```

## API Documentation
